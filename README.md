# Task-2-Handwritten-Character-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning

This project involves building and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for handwritten character recognition using a custom dataset collected from 10 individuals. It combines deep learning with real-world data to assess the performance of character recognition algorithms.

## üéØ Objective

1. Understand and interpret a pre-written CNN architecture for character recognition.
2. Create a block diagram illustrating the model structure.
3. Train the model on a provided dataset and a newly collected dataset.
4. Collect handwritten character samples from 10 individuals (50 characters each).
5. Evaluate the model on real-world handwritten data (500 test samples).
6. Report and interpret performance using Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall.

## üß† Model Architecture

The CNN model includes:

- Input Layer  
- Convolutional Layers (with ReLU activation)  
- Pooling Layers (MaxPooling)  
- Flatten Layer  
- Fully Connected Dense Layers  
- Output Layer (Softmax for classification)

## üß™ Data Collection & Preprocessing

- 10 individuals provided 50 handwritten characters each (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
- Images were labeled and organized into folders by class.
- Preprocessing steps included resizing, normalization, and grayscale conversion.
